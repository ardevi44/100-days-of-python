# 100 days of Python
---

Well this is just my advance about the Udemy online course.
[Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

I'm seen inside the course there is no more repository with the code of the whole course.

So I'm sharing this with the community. I'm trying to put my code or my solutions plus the solutions of the instructor. So this way you will have the closest thing to the original code, and my solutions.

## About the content
---

I am putting the code per day. In each of these days you'll see a several files.
- Some of theme are just sample code (The instructor exercises and some tries by my self)
- Others will have the final projects of each section (each day). My solution and the instructor ones.

Here you have a link to some of the most useful projects that are inside the days
*Those are just the files in the repo, not a demo*
- [Day 2 - Tip calculator](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/2nd_day/tip_calculator.py)
- [Day 3 - Treasure island](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/3rd_day/treasure-island.py)
- [Day 4 - Rock, paper, scissors](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/4th_day/rock_paper_scissors.py)
- [Day 5 - Password generator](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/5th_day/password_generator.py)
- [Day 7 - Hangman console game](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/7th_day/hangman.py)
- [Day 8 - Caesar cipher](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/8th_day/caesar_cipher_project/caesar_cipher.py)
- [Day 9 - Secret auction program](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/9th_day/secret_auction_program.py)
- [Day 10 - Calculator console program](https://github.com/ardevi44/100-days-of-python/blob/main/10th_day/calculator.py)

## How to run the files
---
- Like any other repo you'll have to cloning first or downloaded or whatever just make sure to have it in your local machine.
- Then open the repo source folder in your terminal.
- Well, and just like any other .py file. If you have installed python just run the `python` command plus the name of the file. *`python sample.py`*. And that's it

Of course if you don't have python installed just follow the instructions in this link
[Python downloads](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

And ... You got it.

## A personal note
---
I'm really happy to share this advance with you. I know is not a great repo and any of this code isn't like a pro level but is something, is my advance and I like so much code this for my self, for you, or for any others learners who are seeking some useful code and logic. I know as well now there is IA you really don't need this but remember the base of knowledge of that models are this. The code of ourselves. Have a good day and code fun.
